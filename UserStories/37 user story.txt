------------------------------   Customer perspective

1. As a registered user I should be able to see the amount of available products,
 so that I can place an order of my choice.
2. As a registered user I should be able to place an order
 only if the product is availbale on merchant side.
3. As a registered user I should change my specs if my selected specs are unavailable so that
 I can buy my second choice  
4. As a user I should change my address so that 
 I can check if product is availbale at the new location



------------------------------- Merchant perspective


1. As a registered merchant I should check for the order confirmation 
so that I can make a change in the inventory level
2. As a registered merchant I should be updating the inventory 
so that user can check the quantity of available products for purchase
